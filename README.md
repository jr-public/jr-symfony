# Deployment

## Quick Start

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jr-public/jr-symfony
   cd jr-symfony
   ```

2. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build --pull always --wait
   ```

3. **Initialize the database with sample data**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec php bin/console app:seed
   ```

The application will be available at:
- **API**: http://localhost:80
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (PostgreSQL)
- **Redis**: localhost:6379

### Cleanup Commands

**Remove old volumes** (if you need a fresh start):
```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans -v
```

**Copy vendor files** to your local machine (for IDE autocomplete):
```bash
# Find the PHP container ID
docker ps

# Copy vendor directory (replace PHP_APP_ID with actual container ID)
docker cp PHP_APP_ID:/app/vendor ./
```
